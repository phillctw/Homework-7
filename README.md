## Web Scraping exercises using Python

This repository contains exercises where I use Python to perform web scraping on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States) and [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr). BeautifulSoup and Pandas libraries were used for the scraping.

For the Le Monde exercise, the script collects every articleâ€™s title, subheader, URL, premium status, byline, article type, and image URL from the homepage.

## Auto-updating scraping

I also implemented an auto-updating code that scrapes Le Monde site every 5 hours and generates a new .csv output file.
